## DEADNAME

### AmEx
I'm an American.\
I want you to feel my Excellence.

This body feels alien.\
Pump me full of estrogen.

I caught your hand in the honeypot.\
I caught your hand in the cookie jar.


I want you to grab my pussy raw.\
I want you to fuck me raw.


Let in the caravan!\
I'm on PrEP!


American Exceptionalism.

### Safe as Houses
I have a body;\
no place to call my home.

Come on, baby, live in these 4 walls.\
You’ll never suck the marrow from my bones.

### Pop
You’re like a ghost.

You only love me when I’m swollen.\
You only love me when I’m swollen, baby.

You only love me.\
You only love.


You only love me when you’re swollen, baby.


Piss on everything that I love.\
You piss on everything that I love.\
You piss on everything.


& then you pop me open.\
Pop me open.\
Pop!
